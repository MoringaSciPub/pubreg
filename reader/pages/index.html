<h1>Moringa Science Publishing Publication Database</h1>
<h2>Publishing in Times of Decentralized Science</h2>
<p>
    One of the main responsibilities of publishers is to document the publishing of works, i.e. to not only make the work public,
    but also to add relevant metadata like the name of the author, the date of the publication and the place where it was published.
    We at <a href="https://moringa.pub">Moringa Science Publishing</a> publish the works mainly on our
    <a href="https://moringa.pub">web page</a>, but also on the distributed filesystem <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>.
    This has the advantage that readers can use their webbrowser to access the <a href="https://moringa.pub/ojs/">articles</a>
    and <a href="https://moringa.pub/books/">books</a>, and can use IPFS in case our webserver is not available. IPFS also
    automatically makes copies of downloaded works and makes them available to the network again, which keeps published
    works available and safe.
</p>
<p>
    To further secure the authenticity of this meta data, we use Blockchain as technology. Every publication (for now of articles,
    we might extend it to books and other works as well) is registered on a private permission less Blockchain by us.
    This creates a permanent record of our publications together with their metadata.
</p>

<h2>Blockchainified List of Publications</h2>
<p>
    This list contains all works that we have published on the <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin blockchain</a>. You find the links to the texts in
    <a href="https://moringa.pub/ojs/">our webpage</a>,
    as well as the IPFS system (linked to the <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/">IPFS.io</a> service, but if you
    <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/">run your own node</a>,
    you can directly use the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/hashes/">IPFS hash</a> to download the article.
    Each blockchain transaction contains a signed message with the IPFS hash of the article meta data. The signatur's public
    key is <tt>22eea0792b1bd631028e3a818f03dbbb87a7ef6fbe8562179066432853d6f1e5</tt>.
